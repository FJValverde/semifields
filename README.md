# semifields
An attempt to enrich spire/algebra with semifields.

The concept lattice of semifields in the context of semirings. Names with asterisks are abstract structures. The intents describe their properties.
The complete idempotent semifields in the center, the fuzzy semirings to the left, the standard (semi)fields to the right.
